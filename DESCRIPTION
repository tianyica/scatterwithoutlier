Description: This function takes a dataset(as a list, and dataframes/tibbles are lists) of two quantitative variables and fits a single linear regression model from them, then it displays a scatterplot with fitted regression line. Also, it displays any influential points as red color based on user defined criteria (cut-off for cookâ€™s distance).
